    <h1>Communication</h1>
    <p>Communication is a two-way process involving the following elements: a sender, a message, a medium, a channel, a receiver, a response and feedback. However, it is not sufficient to have just all these elements; there should be cooperation and understanding between the two parties involved.
    </p>
    <h2>Effective Communication</h2>
    <p>Effective communication means where we know what we are trying to communicate and the audience is getting exactly what we are trying to say. This communication is a very important aspect of both our professional and personal lives. It involves developing certain skills with the help of which we can exchange information with more clarity, understanding, and empathy.
